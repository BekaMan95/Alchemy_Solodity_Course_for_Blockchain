# Alchemy_Solidity_Course_for_Blockchain

Welcome to the Alchemy Solidity Course for Blockchain! We are a dedicated team of learners diving into the world of blockchain through this comprehensive bootcamp. This course is structured into four chapters, each focusing on different aspects of Solidity and smart contracts.

## Chapter 1: Solidity Introduction

### Course Overview
This chapter provides an overview of the course and an introduction to Solidity and smart contracts.

### Smart Contracts Overview
- Value Types:Explore the fundamental value types in Solidity.
- Basic Solidity Data Types:Learn about storage variables and how to work with basic data types in Solidity. This includes:
  - Storage Variables
  - Tasks to practice data types

### Functions and Value Types
- Storage Variables:Understand how smart contracts store persistent state.
- Functions:Learn how to build and use functions in Solidity.

## Chapter 2: Address Interactions

### Sending Ether
- Message Calls:Learn how to send value and data to smart contracts using message calls.
- Practice Sending Ether:Hands-on practice to reinforce your learning.

### Reverting Transactions
- Revert:Understand how to undo state changes when something goes wrong.

### Calling Contracts
- Targeting Functions:Learn how to target external functions on a smart contract.
- Escrow:Dive into creating an escrow smart contract.

## Chapter 3: Reference Types

### Arrays
Learn how to store a collection of elements in Solidity.

### Structs
Understand how to group several variables under a single name using structs.

### Mappings
Explore one of the most important data types in Solidity: mappings, and understand how this key/value data type works.

## Chapter 4: Applied Solidity

### Voting Smart Contract
Build a real-world smart contract: a voting contract.

### Inheritance
Learn how to extend other smart contracts through inheritance.
